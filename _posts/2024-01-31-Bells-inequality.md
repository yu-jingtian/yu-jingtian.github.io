# Quantum correlation

In quantum mechanics, quantum correlation is the expected value of the product of the alternative outcomes. [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_correlation).

In Bell's 1964 paper, assume two outcomes $A$ and $B$, and each has two outcomes $+1$, $-1$. Then by definition of quantum correlation, first we need "the product of the alternative outcomes"
