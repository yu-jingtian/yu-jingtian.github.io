I start building this website on Nov. 14, 2022. The initial trial is [here](https://github.com/yu-jingtian/website_trial), and the main reference is [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5g-lUuFgpg). The reason is that I want to post a web app about the **capital asset pricing model (CAPM)** and **value at risk (VaR)**.
